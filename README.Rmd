# Introduction

To scrape the titles of news articles from the `OnlineKhabar` in R, we need to use `rvest` package

See `scrap.R` script to see how i have done

```{r}
library(rvest)

URL <- "https://www.onlinekhabar.com/"
html_content <- read_html(URL)


titles <- html_nodes(html_content, "h2") %>%
  html_text()
titles <- gsub("\n", "", titles)

vect <- stringr::str_length(titles)

# Need to remove the titles that are very sort . This has been extracted because
# They are tag H2 class in HTML but are not tilte


titles1 <- titles[stringr::str_length(titles)>15]
titles1

```
